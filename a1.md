# CS 1501 Assignment 1 -zhw87

## Data Structure for the problem
- 2D Array
   * The read-in board is stored in a 2D Array for later reference.
   * When the solution is found, the 2D Array containing the board gets rewritten with the solution.
- StringBuilder
   * Two arrays of StringBuilders, one for row and one for column. Each row/col gets its own StringBuilder. They are used as temporary storage of letters.
   * Add/delete letters as the search algorithm goes.
   * read the final solution values to the board matrix.
- ArrayList<Integer> []
   * Each row holds an array of Arraylists of Integers to store the index of '-' signs.
   * After reading in the board, for example, the value in the board[i][j] contains a '-' sign. Then value j will be added to the ith ArrayList.
   * Used to check if the letters before each '-' sign is a valid word
- HashMap<String, Integer>
   * Store the pairs of letter and its point as reading in the letterpoints.txt file.
   * After finding the solution, it can be used as a look-up table. The .get() method can find the point for each letter.
- char[]
   * Stores the alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.
   * Used when checking the prefix/word property of words for '+' cells.

## Algorithm
   * Starting from the beginning (0,0) of the board, check cell by cell going by row (i.e. the next cell we check is the right neighbor of the current cell, or the first cell in the next row).
   * Suppose the cell is board[i][j] for easier reference here 
      - Case 1: the cell contains '+' (it is an open cell)
	1. starting from letter 'a', possibly checking until 'z':
	  2. check the searchPrefix() of the builders related to the cell (if the builder contains any '-', just check the substring after the last '-' sign)
	  3. check if the rules are satisfied:
		- if we reach the last column/row, the string in the builder before it + the possible letter must be a valid word;
		- if we are in the middle (not last column or last row), the string in the builder before it + the possible letter must be a valid prefix.
	   4. If yes, we append the letter to both related row/col builders. Then check if we reached the end of the board. If yes, we finish the puzzle, print out the solution and score, then exit. If not, we go to the next cell. If j is at the end of a column (not the last one), we go to board[i+1][0] to search the next line. If not, we simply increment j to search the right neighbor cell. Add delete at the end for backtracking later if needed.
	   5. If no, we continue to check if the next letter in the alphabet fits.
       - Case 2: the cell contains '-' (solid space cannot fill in)
	 1. we refer to the ArrayList of the ith line and get the ArrayList index of j.
	   2. if board[i][j] is the first cell containing '-' in this row:
		- searchPrefix() the substring from the beginning of the builder to the cell before the '-'. 
	   3. else if it is not the first '-' in the row
		- searchPrefix() the substring between the last '-' index and this '-'.
	   4. These substrings should be valid words (else it will backtrack to the previous cell to correct). Then we append '-' to our builders.
	   5. If it is the end of the board, we finish and print. If not, go to the next cell (the condition is the same as the last case). Also add delete().
       - Case 3: the cell contains a pre-set letter
	  append the letter to the related builders. If it is the end of the board, we finish and print. If not, go to the next cell and add delete at the end (same as before).

## Coding/Debugging challenges
   * the backtracking delete()
       - At first, I misused delete(): everytime I found the prefix condition was violated, I called the delete(). The result was that everything in the builders were cleaned up. Then I reviewed the BoggleSolver problem again and thought about backTracking. It should be added at the end of the recursion call, so when the recursion returns because a letter in the previous cell need to be changed, it can call the delete() and find a match again.
   * the '-' case
       - I did not find a good way to track the position of each '-' . In other words, I did not know how I could search for the substring to find a prefix if I encounter multiple '-' signs in a board. Inspired by Professor Khattab that we could have lastIndexRow[] and lastIndexCol[] to store the last index of each row and column, I thought maybe an Array of ArrayList containing indices of '-' in each row would be more concise. And ArrayList could grow dynamically as we add items in, so I thought it was better than a fixed plain Array, especially for the case that rows had different numbers of '-' in each of them.

## Asymptotic analysis for the worst-case
   * Suppose-
     x: number of crossword locations in the puzzle;
     n: number of words in a dictionary;
     d: number of characters in a word;
     a: numbers of possible letters in a crossword location;
   Then the worse case runtime is
	(n*d) + (a)^(x)
       * Explanation: 
       - (1) For each location in the puzzle, we have at most a choices to make, which results in (a)^(x) run-time
       - (2) Taking into account the searchforPrefix() time, if we do an exhaustive search, it will take the most time. Suppose for each character in the word, we do an exhaustive search through all the words in the dictionary, which is n*d run-time.
